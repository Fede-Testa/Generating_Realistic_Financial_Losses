utils.py:
 - generator log has useless arguments?
 - make fake data should be a method of the GAN class
 - handle the less utils (see if you should keep them or not)
 - move training parts to class files (create a class for EDM and one for WGAN)

The parser will go into the main code, args sould already be parsed when passed to the model

Structure to give:
Generative modelling
---data folder
------data.csv
---explanation.pdf
---models.py (containing the classes to build, train, save, load the models)
---utils.py (distances and other useful functions)
---main.ipynb
---train_gan.py + run_training.sh as examples for tensorboard
